title: Terminal Pagers
---

A terminal pager is a command line utility that allows you to view the contents of a text file or the output of a command one page at a time in a terminal window, using the up and down arrow keys or the space bar. Common pagers include less and more. To use a pager, you can pipe the output of a command or the contents of a file to the pager using the | symbol. For example: command | less or less file.txt.
