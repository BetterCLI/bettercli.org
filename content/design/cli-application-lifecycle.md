title: CLI application lifecycle
---

When making decisions in an existing CLI application, or designing a new one, you should **consider specific parts of the CLI application's lifecycle**. It differs from a web application or a service, where you can easily update the code and the users will get the new version the next time they visit the website. CLI applications are much closer to desktop applications.

## What is a CLI application lifecycle?

In this simplified, but already too complicated diagram below, you can see two major parts: **Distribution** and **Lifecycle**:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    code: CLI code
    officialBuild: Official build
    build: Users building their own copy
    release: CLI released to official channels
    caching: Repository mirrors (Artifactory), caching proxies, archiving servers
    artifact: CLI executable is made available
    user_machine: User machine
    uninstall: Cleanup after itself?
    upgrade: Backwards compatibility?
    downgrade: Handling new options and settings?

    state Distribution {
      code --> officialBuild
      code --> build
      officialBuild --> release
      release --> caching : 3rd parties caching your CLI
      build --> artifact
      release --> artifact
      caching --> artifact
      artifact --> [*]
    }

      Distribution --> Lifecycle : Manual installation
      Distribution --> Lifecycle : Package manager
      Distribution --> Lifecycle : Provisioned by administrator
      Distribution --> Lifecycle : Part of a Docker image or a Linux distro

    state Lifecycle {
      [*] --> user_machine
      user_machine --> user_machine : Automatic updates?
      %% TODO: this loop should be at least mentioned: user_machine --> user_machine : Is it running continuously? Or as a one-off command?
      user_machine --> downgrade : User decided to downgrade the CLI
      user_machine --> upgrade : User decided to upgrade the CLI
      user_machine --> uninstall : User decided to uninstall the CLI
    }
```

This page will focus on the **Lifecycle** part of the diagram: **what is happening with the CLI application once it's installed on the user's machine**. Management of the installed application is in the hands of the user. It's not uncommon that CLI applications stay unchanged on a user machine for years. But their options could be dictated by the way you designed your application.

## Installing CLI application

Installation method used will determine user options. For example if a user used a package manager installation path, then lifecycle parts like **upgrading, downgrading and uninstalling are handled by the package manager**. At the same time, auto-upgrading, unless specifically designed to work well with a package manager, could be problematic.

## Autoupdate mechanism

- If you implemented auto update, how good is the experience for users deciding to stick to an older version?

## Upgrading CLI version

- Keep settings untouched, or talk to the user
- rollbacks
  - Handling previous secrets and options
    - For example, when changing a structure of a config file, you will probably include a code to handle or upgrade the old structure. But can your code handle and inform users they are using a structure thatâ€™s too new?

## Downgrading CLI version

## Uninstalling CLI

- clear caches
- clear config store

Upgrading
